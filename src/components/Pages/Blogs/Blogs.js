            <h3><span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Question-2: </span>When should you use NodeJS and when should you use MongoDB ?</h3>
            <p><span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Answer: </span>
                NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, whareas MongoDB is a cross-platform, NoSQL database program. MongoDB uses JSON-like documents to store data. NodeJS runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Basically, it is used for server-side development.</p>

            <p>
                NodeJS is used for non-blocking, event-driven servers. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services. On the other hand, MongoDB is used for storing data of a website. When the data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when it is needed to accommodate massive scale it is a good choice to use MongoDB instead of using any other SQL Database.

            <h3><span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Question-4: </span>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work ?</h3>
            <p><span style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Answer: </span>
                JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard which is used to share security information between two parties, a client and a server or server to server.
                Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects and a claim. The claim cannot be altered once the token is issued.

                After a user logs in to an application, the application will create a JWT and send it back to the user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the JWT. The token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access.
